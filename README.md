This is the repo for my home infrastructure including a kubernetes cluster. My cluster runs on [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) and is managed with [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) and the rest of my machines run on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

## ü§ù Thanks

A huge thank you for all the maintainers of the dependencies used by this project as well as onedr0p for the awesome [cluster template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) which was used to initially create this repo. If you'd like to get started with your own cluster be sure to check it out.
